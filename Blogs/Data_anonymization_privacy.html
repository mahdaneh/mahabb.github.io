      <h1>Anonymized Synthetic Data Generation by DP-GAN</h1>
        <div class="overview">
<b> Overview: briefly reviewing Differential Privacy Generative Adversarial Network (DP-GAN) as a generative model for synthesizing anonymous data samples. </b>
        </div>

<br>


  <h2 id="s1"> 1. Why generation of synthetic data can reserve data privacy?</h2>
  
<p>
 Many industries from insurance companies
    to financial institutions to
    care(health)-providing agencies
    have access to an ocean of information (in form of structured tabular data)
    that can be used for making more informed decisions and recognizing new strategies and policies to not only increase their profits
    but also enhance the quality of their services, resulting in higher customers satisfaction.
    Machine learning and data mining techniques can
    effectively extract some data-driven insights from such tremendously large and rich datasets
    if they can be shared with some third-party
    research institutions.
</p>
        <p>

    Notably, the datasets usually contain an
    enormous amount of sensitive and personal information and mishandling them can drastically threaten the data privacy of customers.
Thus, before sharing these sensitive data with any third-party research institutions,
    the holders of these datasets have to guarantee and preserve the privacy of their customers' information.
    Data anonymization is one of the approaches for preserving data privacy as
    it aims to make <strong>de-identification attacks</strong>
    very hard or preferably impossible.
    In meantime, the anonymized data should preserve the statistical properties and the patterns existed

    in the original but unprotected data
    in order to allows ML techniques
    to extract and learn these patterns for a variety of tasks, such as predictive models.
    This leads us to a dilemma; <b>privacy v.s. utility</b>.

<p>

To address both these criteria (privacy v.s. utility), one requires
    to devise a method to generate <b>synthetic anonymized data</b>
    that I) pertains statistical properties of the original data
    (measured by a utility metric) while
    II) preserving the privacy of customers information (which can be quantified by a privacy metric, e.g. DP).</p>
<p>
To create such synthetic anonymized data, one can either <b>fully or partially synthetic data</b>. In the former,
all the features (attributes) of a given dataset are considered as sensitive data, thus analysts should generate fully
synthetic data records to be used instead of the original data records.
While in the latter, regarding some features as sensitive, the analysts tend to either synthesize values for these attributes
or censor them without hurting the utility while keeping the privacy risk, e.g. identity disclosure, low.

<h2 id="s2">  2. MedGAN: a variant of GAN to generate data from different types </h2>


<p>
Generally speaking, vanilla GAN learns to estimate the distribution of data, then through sampling from this estimated data distribution,
 many data samples can be generated. As GAN is originally  proposed  for  image  datasets,  
 where  the data  samples  contain  real-value  features, and is trained regardless of any privacy measurements.
   However, we aim to generate privacy-preserved synthetic <strong>tabular data</strong> 
   with categorical, discrete, binary or mixed features (data attributes). 
   MedGAN [1] is proposed to generate such discrete-value anonymized features, particularly for medical structured dataset.
</p>



<p>
In order to generate synthetic discrete-value, the author of MedGAN incorporate an encoder-decoder. 
The pre-trained encoder ($Enc(\cdot)$) maps each real record represented by $\mathbf{x}\in\mathcal{Z}_{+}^{D}$
 (from a $D$-dimensional discrete-value space) into a continuous feature space, then the decoder ($Dec(\cdot)$) 
 maps it back to the discrete-value space. The generator $G(\cdot)$ takes in random prior $\mathbf{z}$ 
 to generate continuous-value feature ($G(\mathbf{z})$), which then maps back to the discrete-value space by $Dec (G(\mathbf{z})) $. Finally, the discriminator is trained to distinguish the generated samples from the real samples.
 </p>
 <p>
  The privacy of MedGAN's data generated has been empirically assessed by different privacy metrics~\cite{choi2017generating,goncalves2020generation}, but it is better if the generative model can be explicitly trained somehow for encouraging privacy.

<h2 id ="s3"> 3. Experiment</h2>
We use home credit dataset, a Kaggle dataset for predicting repayment abilities of customers according to some attributes. First, the dataset is pre-processed as follows:
<ol>
    <li> <strong>Outlier removal</strong>: Outliers per attribute are detected according to their z-score (z-score>3), then removed.</li>
    <li> <strong>Data imputation</strong>: using mean and most-frequency strategies, missing values of the real-value and categorical attributes are imputed, respectively.</li>
    <li><strong>Encoding categorical attributes </strong>: categorical attributes indicated by string are encoded to be integer type categorical data.</li>
    <li><strong>Data standardization </strong>: float-type attributes are standardized to interval $[0,1]$</li>

</ol>
