  <h1> Introduction</h1>
<p>
  
  Modern CNN-based object detectors such as faster R-CNN and YOLO achieve remarkable performance when trained 
  on fully labeled large-scale datasets, which include both instance-level annotations (\ie bounding boxes around each object of interest) 
  and image-level labels (\ie category of the object enclosed in a bounding box) for all the Objects of Interest (OoIs). 
  On the one hand, collecting a dataset with full annotations, specifically bounding boxes, can be a tedious and costly process.
  On the other hand, the object detectors such as R-CNN and YOLO show that their performance is dependent on having access to such fully labeled datasets. 
  In other words, training them on partially labelled datasets (\ie containing instances with missing-labels) leads to a drop in generalization performance ~\cite{wu2018soft,zhang2018weakly,wu2018soft}.

  \[x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.\]-->

    Several scenarios can lead to a parially labelled datasets:
    <ul>
      <li>Unintentional error in labelling</li>
      <li> partial annotation policy:To reduce annotation cost, "partial annotation policy" considers 
        to annotate only one instance of each object presented in a given image. For example, in an image containing a herd of sheep, only one sheep is annotated, instead of fully annotating all the sheep instances in the image. This policy causes some missing bounding box
        annotations but interestingly no missing image-level labels as at least one instance of each existing object in the given image is annotated.</li>
         <li>Merged dataset</li>
      </ul>
