<h1>Self-supervised framework for generating pseudo-labels</h1>

<p> <a href='./Blogs/Object_Detector.html'>In previous blog post</a>, 
  we explained how missing-label instances or UPIs (Unlabelled Positive Instances) can create 
  false negative signals, causing performance declination of a modern object detector, e.g. YOLO.
   Here, we propose to mitigate this challenge through generating pseudo-labels for the UPIs to reduce the number of false negative signals. 
</p>
<p>Briefly, our method is an end-to-end solution, meaning that during training of YOLO, it recognizes UPIs, then generates pseudo-labels. 
To this end, we incorporate a pre-trained proxy model (Augmented CNN-- a vanilla CNN with an extra class added to its output) to indicate whether the ROIs estimated by YOLO (during its training) contain an object of interest or not. 
If the proxy model classifies an ROI as its extra class (meaning it contains an not-interesting object), it is discarded, otherwise, the coordinate information of ROI along with its estimated class and its associated confidence provided by A-CNN are considered as a pseudo-label.
</p>
<p>
 In Fig 1, we show the overall pip-line of our proposed method for generating pseudo-labels during training YOLO,
 where it simultaneously is trained on both ground truths and the generated pseudo-labels.
