# Bio
 I am the last-year P.h.D student at [Electrical and Computer Engineering Department](https://www.gelgif.ulaval.ca/accueil/) of [Universite Laval](https://www.ulaval.ca/en/)(UL) under supervision of [Christian Gagne](http://vision.gel.ulaval.ca/~cgagne/) and [Denis Laurendeau](http://vision.gel.ulaval.ca/~laurend/). My current research revolves around dependeble and secure learning models to adversarial examples and Out-of-Distribution samples. Before joining UL, I was a researcher master student at [Digitial Media Lab](http://dml.ir/) of [Sharif University of Technology](http://www.en.sharif.edu/), working on [3D human pose estimation](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7335521/) under supervision [H. Reza. Rabiee](http://sharif.edu/~rabiee/).

# My Research Interests
- Dependable and Secure Deep Neural Networks
   - Uncertainty Estimation, Detection of adversarial examples & Out-of-Distribution samples
- Adversarial Networks; Domain Adversarial Networks (DAN), Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)
- Computer Vision
   - Robust Object Detection, 3D Human Pose Estimation
